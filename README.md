This is a quick experiment with Node.js and MongoDB. Nothing too fancy, but I got it to work as I wanted.

## What is this? 
So... do you know when you are in the toilet and you think of something stupid but you want to get it done no matter what? Happened to me today, like 2 hours ago. This allows you to send a message that can only be seen once and after that, it will be destroyed forever.

## Installation
To install, you just need to clone this repository and run `npm install`. Start the server with `node app.js`. Don't forget to get MongoDB up and running and, obviousy, change the `db.js` file according to your settings.
